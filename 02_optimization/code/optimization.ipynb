    "## Context\n",
    "Welcome to the next part of your third programming assignment.\n",
    "In this part you will implement different optimization methods and learn how all of them lead to different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Optimization of your model's parameters during training is necessary, to ensure convergence and good prediction results. Until now, you've always used Gradient Descent to update the parameters and minimize the cost. In this notebook, you'll gain skills with some more advanced optimization methods that can speed up learning and perhaps even get you to a better final value for the cost function. Having a good optimization algorithm can be the difference between waiting days vs. just a few hours to get a good result.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply optimization methods such as (Stochastic) Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp and Adam\n",
    "* Use random minibatches to accelerate convergence and improve optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- You will be using Python 3.\n",
    "- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes for Your Submission\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the mentioned, our test scripts will fail and as a result you will receive **0 points** for the respective task.\n",

    "During the first part of training, your model can get away with taking large steps, but over time, using a fixed value for the learning rate alpha can cause your model to get stuck in a wide oscillation that never quite converges. But if you were to slowly reduce your learning rate alpha over time, you could then take smaller, slower steps that bring you closer to the minimum. This is the idea behind learning rate decay.\n",
