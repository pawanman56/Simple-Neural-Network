    "## Context\n",
    "Welcome to the first part of your third programming assignment.\n",
    "In this first part you will implement different weight initialization methods and learn how all of them lead to different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Training your neural network requires specifying an initial value for the weights and bias parameters. A well-chosen initialization method can hereby help the learning process of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- You will be using Python 3.\n",
    "- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes for Your Submission\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the mentioned, our test scripts will fail and as a result you will receive **0 points** for the respective task.\n",

    "- The cost starts very high. This is because with large random-valued weights, the last activation (sigmoid) outputs results that are very close to 0 or 1 for some examples, and when it gets that example wrong it incurs a very high loss for that example. Indeed, when $\\log(a^{[3]}) = \\log(0)$, the loss goes to infinity.\n",
    "- Poor initialization can lead to vanishing/exploding gradients, which also slows down the optimization algorithm.\n",
    "- If you train this network longer you will see better results, but initializing with overly large random numbers slows down the optimization.\n",
    "- Initializing weights to very large random values doesn't work well.\n",
    "- Initializing with small random values should do better. The important question is, how small should be these random values be? Let's find out up next!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional Read:**\n",
    "The main difference between Gaussian variable (`numpy.random.randn()`) and uniform random variable is the distribution of the generated random numbers:\n",
    "- numpy.random.rand() produces numbers in a [uniform distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jahnog/deeplearning-notes/master/Course2/images/rand.jpg).\n",
    "- and numpy.random.randn() produces numbers in a [normal distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jahnog/deeplearning-notes/master/Course2/images/randn.jpg).\n",
    "\n",
    "When used for weight initialization, randn() helps most the weights to avoid being close to the extremes, allocating most of them in the center of the range.\n",
    "An intuitive way to see it is, for example, if you take the [sigmoid() activation function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jahnog/deeplearning-notes/master/Course2/images/sigmoid.jpg).\n",
    "You’ll remember that the slope near 0 or near 1 is extremely small, so the weights near those extremes will converge much more slowly to the solution, and having most of them near the center will speed the convergence."
